When new releases of datasets are ready I'll delete old git repo and make new one, I'm not going to mess with removing the old physical files and rewriting history. 
==========================
To collapse/uncollapse rows in MS Excel and LibreOffice spreadsheets, click on the small #1 and #2 boxes at very top of column that shows row numbers.  File doesnâ€™t open cleanly in LibreOffice (required a file Recovery) but seems to work ok after that.
===============
To uncollapse rows in OS X Numbers spreadsheet, hover mouse cursor over any column number on the left and click the down arrow that appears to the right.
